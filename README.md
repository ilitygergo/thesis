# Thesis

In this project, my task was to implement and compare 5 different thinning algorithms for grayscale pictures.

The common method, up until these attempts, was to convert the grayscale images to binary pictures and thin the result.

These algorithms provide a different approach.

The papers in chronological order:
* Thinning algorithms for grayscale pictures 1997 (Dyer Rosenfeld)
* The ridge-seeking method for obtaining the skeleton of digital images 1984 (Salari Siy)
* Skeletonization for grayscale character images using pixel superiority index 1998 (Kang Et Al)
*  Gray-scale thinning algorithm using local min/max operations 2006 (Kim)
* A parallel thinning algorithm for grayscale images 2013 (Couprie Et Al)
